              I have designed and developed web-based applications. These tools cover a broad spectrum of functions. They include interactive web pages, allowing users to track and view small amounts of data. These utilize many different type of interfaces, from SOAP and RESTful API, to XDR to direct JDBC or direct calls to a database. Some of these interfaces have been documented and other have been undocumented with proprietary systems which require extensive coordination and negotiation with the venders. I have developed requirements in waterfall and agile cycles; captured, implemented and refinement of Concept of Operations; created training material; trained users and dedicated trainers; and performed system maintenance. I simultaneously work on several projects and meet conflicting deadlines. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Worked embedded in a 24/7 high pressure operational environment as a liaison troubleshooting software (and personel) problems; coordinated software installations; and coordinated, planned and executed multi-system global testing. I have identified design changes to improve operational efficiency and/or reduce cost of operations. 
          </p>
            More recently I have lead baseline teams on multi-million dollar projects through a modified waterfall design cycle to successful installation. On serval occasions my concepts and functional design have lead to multi million dollar contracts.
          <p>
          I look forward new challenges where I can apply my existing knowledge and new found skills to new organization be it at an entry level or mid level programming position.
